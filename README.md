# 🚢 Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns, trends, and relationships using statistics and visualizations.

This task was completed as part of an AI & ML Internship assignment.

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset: Titanic Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- File Used: Titanic-Dataset.csv

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab / Kaggle Notebook

## 🔍 Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Loaded dataset using pandas
- Displayed first few rows

### 2️⃣ Data Inspection
- Checked shape and columns
- Used `.info()` for data types
- Generated summary statistics

### 3️⃣ Missing Values Analysis
- Identified missing values
- Visualized using heatmap

### 4️⃣ Data Visualization
- Histograms for numeric features
- Boxplots for outlier detection
- Pairplots for relationships

### 5️⃣ Correlation Analysis
- Created correlation matrix heatmap
- Observed feature relationships

### 6️⃣ Survival Analysis
- Survival count
- Survival by gender
- Survival by passenger class

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Fare is positively skewed with some extreme outliers.
- Age column contains missing values.
- Passenger class and fare show correlation with survival.
